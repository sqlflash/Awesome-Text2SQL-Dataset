# Awesome-Text2SQL-Dataset
Awesome-Text2SQL-Dataset is a curated collection of datasets specifically designed for the Text-to-SQL task ‚Äî the challenge of converting natural language questions into SQL queries. As a critical component of natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB), Text2SQL plays a vital role in enabling users to interact with data using everyday language.

This repository aims to provide researchers, developers, and practitioners with a comprehensive list of datasets that support the development and evaluation of Text2SQL models. Whether you‚Äôre exploring schema linking, complex SQL generation, cross-domain generalization, or conversational query generation, you‚Äôll find relevant datasets here to accelerate your work.

We welcome contributions to keep this list up-to-date and useful for the community.
